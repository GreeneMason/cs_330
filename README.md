# CS 330 - Machine Learning Project: UFC Fight Prediction

## Project Overview
This repository contains my machine learning project for CS 330. The project focuses on analyzing UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) data to create predictive models for fight outcomes.

## Project Goals
- Develop machine learning models to predict UFC fight outcomes
- Analyze fighter statistics and historical data
- Apply various machine learning techniques learned in CS 330
- Create meaningful insights from UFC fight data

## Technologies
- Python
- Machine Learning Libraries (to be determined)
- Data Analysis Tools
- UFC Dataset (Kaggle)

## Structure
First thoughts;
- Use SportsBERT from Google
- Take the summary from SportsBERT and feed it with fighter stats to XGBoost or LightGBM
- Engineer features to account for winstreaks, fight camp lenght, fight camp location
